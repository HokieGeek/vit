Vit
===

What became of the little helper functions I made that would tie Git into Vim. Now they're all grown up and needed to move out into their own plugin.

Vit integrates git into vim by providing a number of interactive windows that allow the user to view git information about the file they are currently looking at as well as modify that file's git status.

## Features

### Commands

Only one command is provided: `Git`

### Interactive windows

## Installation

I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and then executing the following steps in a shell:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/HokieGeek/vit.git
